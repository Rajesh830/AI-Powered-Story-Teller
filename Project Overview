Overview:

The AI-Powered Storyteller is a Generative AI project that automates video storytelling, turning simple text prompts into engaging multimedia narratives. By integrating state-of-the-art AI technologies such as GPT-2, Stable Diffusion 2.1, and Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS), this system allows users to create compelling stories without requiring technical expertise or creative skills.

Key Features:


Automated Storytelling Pipeline:
Generates a story from user input using GPT-2.
Transforms story sentences into unique, captivating images with Stable Diffusion 2.1.
Creates immersive audio narration using gTTS.
Combines images, audio, and text into a synchronized video format using the Movie library.
Creative and Accessible: Democratically empowers users to create high-quality multimedia stories.
Dynamic Outputs: Produces polished video outputs in formats like MP4, complete with subtitles and audio.
